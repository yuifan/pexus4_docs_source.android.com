## For Android Compatibility Definition and Compatibility Test Suite Technical Questions ##
If you have questions about Android compatibility that aren't covered in this site, you can reach
us in one of a few different ways. To get the most out of any of these options, please first read "Getting the Most from Our
Lists" on the [Community page](/community/index.html). If you have specific issues with the Compatibility Test Suite or the Compatibility Definition
[android-compatibility list.](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/android-compatibility) is the discussion forum for you.

- Subscribe using Google Groups: [android-compatibility](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/android-compatibility)
- Subscribe via email: [android-building](mailto:android-compatibility+subscribe@googlegroups.com)

Note that if you're a user looking for help with your Android device, this page probably isn't for you;
you should contact your carrier or manufacturer for help with your Android device.

## For Business Inquiries ##

Finally, business inquiries about the compatibility program, including
requests to use branding elements and so on, can be sent to the address [android-partnerships@google.com](mailto:android-partnerships@google.com). Like
the CTS address, this address is for specific, private inquiries; general
questions will be directed back to the android-compatibility list.
